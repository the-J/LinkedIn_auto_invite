### LinkedIn Auto Invite Script
#### Simple brute force LinkedIn auto invite script for Tampermonkey browser extension

* install `Tampermonkey` for your browser (or any other userscript manager) 
* create new script
* copy script.js content to new script
* goto to lin -> search (ex. sailor) -> select: people -> (optional) filter results (2nd, 3rd, region, etc.)
* hit ugly red button 'start connecting' that should show up on your page in upper left corner
* go for a coffee. 
```
Checked on FF desktop and I will not check any other browser (should work fine).

It is ugly code and done with brute force technic. I don't care, it does what it should. 
Enjoy!

TODO: At some moment it will fail as LIn has daily limit for invites and I don't know it.
